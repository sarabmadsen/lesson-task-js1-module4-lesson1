# JavaScript 1 - Module 4

## Lesson Task 1 Answer

Make a call to the following endpoint:

```
https://t9jt3myad3.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/nbateams
```

Display the team name and city of the first 15 results, but exclude any team whose name begins with `c`.

There will be a maximum of 15 results displayed if no teams' names begin with "C", and less than 15 displayed if there are teams whose names begin with "C".
